In the file called, "GetRequests1.java":

The code provides a robust framework for making API requests, parsing JSON responses, and validating the returned 
data using RestAssured and TestNG.

Key Points:
API Interaction: The code interacts with NASA's Mars Rover Photos API, specifically fetching photos taken by the Curiosity rover.
JSON Parsing: Uses the org.json library to parse and extract data from JSON responses.
Assertions: Utilizes TestNG assertions to validate the response status and specific content within the response.
Logging: Prints the complete URL, status code, response body, and specific extracted values for debugging purposes.

In the file called, "GetRequests2.java":

This code tests the NASA Earth Assets API by sending a GET request to fetch data for a specific geographic location and date. 
It validates the response by checking for the presence of certain keys and prints relevant information extracted from the response.

In the file called, "HTTPProcess6.java":

This code performs end-to-end testing of a REST API by executing a sequence of CRUD operations, 
validating responses, and printing relevant information to the console.
