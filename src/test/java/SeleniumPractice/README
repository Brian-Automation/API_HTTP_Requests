In this java class file I created a Selenium test script which automates the following sequence of actions on the ASOS website:

Opens and verifies the website.
Interacts with a dropdown menu to navigate to the sign-in page.
Fills out a sign-up form with user details.
Selects a gender radio button.
The tests use various Selenium WebDriver features such as JavaScript execution,
explicit waits, and form interactions to ensure smooth automation and validation of web elements.
