The methods in this code are designed to test the parsing of an XML response from a web service using RestAssured 
in a Java environment. Each method takes a slightly different approach to validate specific aspects of the XML response.
Here’s a brief overview of each method's purpose:

In the first method called, "testXMLResponse1":

Purpose: Validate the XML response directly using RestAssured's fluent API.
Details: Checks status code, content type, and specific elements within the XML structure.
Example: Asserts that the first object’s id is "1" and name is "Karl Zboncak".

In the second method called, "testXMLResponse2":

Purpose: Store the response in a variable and perform assertions using XmlPath.
Details: Verifies status code, content type, and specific XML elements after converting them to strings.
Example: Confirms the objectType is "array" and the first object’s name is "Karl Zboncak".

In the third method called, "testXMLResponse3":

Purpose: Use XmlPath class to extract and validate data from the XML response.
Details: Converts response to a string for XML path querying, counts total objects, and verifies the number of objects.
Example: Asserts the total number of objects is 5.

In the last method, called "testXMLResponse4:"

Purpose: Verify the presence of a specific object name using a loop.
Details: Uses XmlPath to get a list of all object names and checks if a specific name exists in the response.
Example: Confirms that the name "Jeffie Wolf I" is present among the object names.

These methods collectively ensure the XML response from the web service is correct and meets expected criteria, 
demonstrating different techniques to parse and validate XML data.
