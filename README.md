This folder contains three files:
1. A fully a automated cycle of HTTP requests, i.e., get, post, put, delete, using rest assured.
  - I created a dummy API using a json-server.
2. Two files which demonstrate my ability to parse through JSON response bodies.
  - For these files I used publically avaiable APIs
